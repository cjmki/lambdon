# AWS Lambda Startup Kit with CLI Tool

## Project Overview

Creating an AWS Lambda startup kit with a CLI tool is a valuable initiative to streamline the development of Lambda functions. This kit will offer developers a structured approach to initialize, manage, and deploy Lambda functions across different runtimes and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) frameworks.

## Project Structure

**Project Structure:**
- **CLI Tool Directory:** This directory, named `lambdon-cli`, will host the code for your CLI tool. It will be responsible for managing user interactions, initializing new projects, generating code, and more.
- **Lambda Template Directory:** In this directory, Lambda function templates will be provided. These templates can be organized by runtime (e.g., Node.js, Python, Go, Rust ...) and will contain the basic structure for Lambda functions in each respective runtime.
- **Documentation Directory:** This directory will include comprehensive documentation and examples on how to use your CLI tool, set up Lambda functions, and best practices.

## Building the CLI Tool

**Building the CLI Tool:**
1. **Initialize a Go Module:** Inside the `lambda-cli` directory, we will create a Go module to manage dependencies. This can be done with the following command:

   ```markup
   go mod init lambda-cli
Create a Command Line Interface: We will use the Cobra library to define and manage CLI commands and flags. Commands will be defined for tasks such as initializing a new Lambda function, building, testing, deploying, and more.

Handle User Inputs: Viper will be used to handle user inputs. This allows for the definition and management of configuration variables, flags, and environment variables.

Project Initialization: When a user wishes to initialize a new Lambda project, the CLI tool will copy the relevant Lambda template from the Lambda Template Directory to their specified project directory.

Code Generation: Code will be generated based on user preferences. For example, if a user selects a specific runtime and IaC framework, the CLI tool will generate Lambda function code and relevant configuration files.

Documentation: We will provide clear and helpful documentation on how to use the CLI tool. Cobra can be used to generate documentation based on the CLI structure.

Testing: Thorough testing will be conducted to ensure that the CLI tool can handle various user inputs and scenarios.

Cross-Platform Compatibility: The CLI tool will be designed to work on different platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Version Management: Consider implementing version management for the CLI tool, allowing users to specify which version they want to use.

Distribution: Once the CLI tool is ready, it will be distributed to users. This can be done by publishing it on package managers like Homebrew, creating releases on GitHub, or hosting it on a dedicated project website.
